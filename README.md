# Hello!

##### Welcome to my mileage calculator project!

The purpose of this site is to allow you to enter commonly traveled routes into a Mapbox javascript plugin, along with the frequency with which you travel those routes, and you will be shown a running tally of your total mileage per year based on the given routes and respective frequencies.

This site utilizes a number of Mapbox APIs in conjunction with the map plugin itself, including the [Directions API](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/directions-api/) to calculate distances and the [Geocoding API](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/geocoding-api/) to guess addresses based on user map clicks.

I plan to add some features soon and fix any bugs as I see them.

Thanks for looking!
